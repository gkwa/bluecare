Flow:

+ pull down list of services if endpoints.json doesn't exist

+ blindly generate console url from service name

+ manually edit console urls if they don't match real console urls

+ git commit edited json and push

+ add new ones to endpoints_edited.json and don't overwrite urls that
  have been modified
